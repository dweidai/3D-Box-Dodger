This is just an endless game created by myself to feel a sense of purpose
The red ball is the player;
You may use keyboard W,A,S,D to control the ball movement.
The game has automatic speed up function; however, if you want to have the
movement even faster, you may press W
S is to temporarily slow down the ball movement and you may also slow down
the ball by hitting the gray cubes.
A means move to the left and D means move to the right.
The goal is to move as far as you can while dodging the blue obstacles.
Falling out the trial or hitting the blue boxes will end your game and your
score will refresh down to 0.
